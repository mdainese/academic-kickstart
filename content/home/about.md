Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm currently a Senior Researcher at the EURAC Research

My research focuses on ecology and conservation of plants and insects in terrestrial ecosystems. I am particularly interested in understanding the ecological consequences of environmental changes, including climate warming and land-use changes, on plant and insect biodiversity.
