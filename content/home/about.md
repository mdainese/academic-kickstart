Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm currently a Senior Researcher at the EURAC Research

My research focuses on ecology and conservation of plants and insects in terrestrial ecosystems. Iâ€™m interested in understanding the main processes that create or alter biodiversity patterns in natural and managed ecosystems.
